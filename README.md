The Telecommunications Retention Manager is currently looking for a robust solution to enhance customer retention initiatives and reduce customer churn.

💠The primary aim of this analysis is to provide valuable insights into the following areas:

🗝️𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐫𝐧 𝐑𝐚𝐭𝐞<br\>
The churn rate, representing the percentage of customers who have discontinued service within a specified period, is evidently a critical metric. Analyzing this rate can provide valuable insights into the reasons for customer departure, enabling the implementation of targeted strategies to minimize it.

🗝️𝐃𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐩𝐡𝐢𝐜 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬<br\>
• 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 : This section presents the number of customers categorized by gender, distinguishing between male and female.<br\>
• 𝐓𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐫𝐞 : Customer tenure varies significantly, from 1 to 72 months, indicating the service has a mix of both new and long-standing customers.<br\>
• 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 : Fiber optic seems to be the most preferred internet service among customers, with DSL coming in second.<br\>
• 𝐎𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 & 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 : Customers who have subscribed to online security and tech support services have a lower churn rate as they value security and assistance.<br\>
• 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 : Customers with longer contract duration, such as one or two years, are less likely to churn compared to those on month-to-month contracts.<br\>

🗝️ 𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐏𝐚𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 <br\>
• 𝐏𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 : Customers who choose paperless billing may exhibit different behavior compared to those who receive paper bills.<br\>
• 𝐏𝐚𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝 : The payment method chosen (e.g., electronic check, credit card, bank transfer) might impact customer loyalty and churn rate.<br\>
• 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐥𝐲 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐬 : Monthly charges for customers range from as low as $20 to over $100. Understanding the reasons for these variations can aid in developing pricing strategies and improving customer retention efforts.<br\>
